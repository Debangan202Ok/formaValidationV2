# formaValidationV2
# A things i learned after made this page 
It's a good practise that made things from scratch. although i after making this i realise how the things work but after this i know that alreary few libraries are available for formValidation and also html5 have their own formValidation attribute likes---`type,min-length,max-length,pattern,required,place-holder,tool-tip` and so on that make your basic validation check. although according to user nedd there are several libraries like:-
# jQuery Validation Plugins
# React Hook Form
# Formik
this are the use full things that make life much easier as a developer. but i recommaned first made things by your own without using libraies
